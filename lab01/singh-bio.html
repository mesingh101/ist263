    <body>
        My name is Mera Singh. I am an Information Management & Technology major with an interest in data analytics and web development. 
        Some of my skills include Python, SQL, R, and Tableau. Aside from working retail at Footlocker and ALDO, I have worked as a data analyst with an automotive company and a social media manager with an online LLC. 
        Outside of work I enjoy staying active such as going to the gym and playing basketball. When I’m not in the gym or on the court, I’m watching Netflix as I’m very fond of crime series including Law & Order SVU or SWAT.
